Coffee Sales Prediction with Gradient Boosting
=============================================

Project Overview:
-----------------
This project predicts the amount of money spent per coffee order using various features such as coffee type, date, and order characteristics.
A Gradient Boosting Regressor was used, along with a pipeline and cross-validation for model evaluation.

Steps Performed:
----------------
1. Data loading and cleaning
2. Feature engineering and encoding
3. Correlation and SHAP analysis
4. Cross-validation using Gradient Boosting
5. Final evaluation on test set
6. Saving results as CSV

Results:
--------
- Cross-validation Mean R² Score: ~0.98
- Test Set R² Score: ~0.98

Files:
------
- prediction_results.csv : predictions with actual values
- README.txt : this file

Usage:
------
Run the script in a Jupyter environment or use it in a Kaggle notebook.
Ensure the dataset is in the correct path.
